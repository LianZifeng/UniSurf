# UniSurf: Universal Lifespan Cortical Surface Reconstruction
We introduce UniSurf, a universal end-to-end deep learning framework designed for cortical surface reconstruction across the entire human lifespan (0-100 years). UniSurf jointly optimizes tissue segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction using a differentiable iso-surface extraction algorithm.
